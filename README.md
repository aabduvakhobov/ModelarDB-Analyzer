# ModelarDB Analyzer
This repository contains the code for the PVLDB paper: "Scalable Model-Based Management of Massive High Frequency Wind Turbine Data with ModelarDB"

Modelar Analyzer is a Python program developed for analyzing the compression effectiveness and compressed data quality from ModelarDB TSMS's error-bounded lossy and lossless compression. We use [ModelarDB's JVM-based implementation](https://github.com/modelardata/modelardb) in our evaluation.

Experiments can be performed with the public [WTM](https://github.com/cmcuza/EvalImpLSTS/tree/main/data/raw/Wind) dataset that can also be found in [data/](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/tree/main/data) directory in different formats and structures (i.e., as univariate and multivariate time series).


## Prerequites
- Java Development Kit for ModelarDB. The following were tested:
  -  OpenJDK 11 
  -  Oracle's Java SE Development Kit 11
- Scala Build Tool (sbt)
- Conda package manager

## Installation
- Clone [ModelarDB Analyzer](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer.git) from this repository
- Navigate to the project root with `cd ModelarDB-Analyzer` and clone [ModelarDB's JVM implementation](https://github.com/modelardata/modelardb)
- Create new virtual environment with conda using the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/blob/main/requirements.txt) file: `conda env create <my_env> --file requirements.txt`
- Activate the new environment: `conda activate <my_env>`


## Instructions to Run
ModelarDB is configured using a configuration file (i.e., `modelardb.conf`). In our experiments, we only use few them, thus we created [config.cfg](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/blob/main/config.cfg) for centralized and simplified management of all configurations used in this paper. For more details on ModelarDB's configuration options, check the [instructions](https://github.com/ModelarData/ModelarDB/blob/main/docs/index.md#config) in ModelarDB repository and the comments in modelardb.conf file. Specifically we only configure the following parameters:
- `modelardb.engine` - processing engine. We use option *spark* (i.e., for Apache Spark) for evaluating OLAP queries, evaluation of compression factor and data quality. 
- `modelardb.source` - file-path or ip:port to the data source. In our case, those high frequency datasets: PCD, MTD and WTM*.
- `modelardb.dimensions` - path to schema file (dimensions file) for specifying a hierarchy for the ingested data. We include the dimensions [file for WTM](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/tree/main/data/ModelarDB_dimension_files). More on dimensions can be [here](https://github.com/ModelarData/ModelarDB/blob/main/docs/index.md#troubleshooting).
- `modelardb.error_bound` - pointwise error bound used for lossy compression with ModelarDB.
- `modelardb.sampling_interval` - sampling interval of the data source. ModelarDB's JVM-based implementation only assumes that the regular time series is provided for ingestion.
- `modelardb.interface` - we configure Apache Arrow Flight interface for the evaluation of OLAP queries with ModelarDB.

*Please note that only [WTM](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/tree/main/data) is a public dataset and can be used for reproducability. Thus, in this repository, we automatically configure all ModelarDB configuration options for WTM. The rest of the parameters are not changed.


### Evaluate ModelarDB's compression effectiveness and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) from its lossy compression

Use **ModelarDB Analyzer** to evaluate ModelarDB's compression effectiveness and MAPE from its lossy compression:
- Change directory to Modelardb: `cd ModelarDB`
- To add extended logging to ModelarDB, apply the [git patch file](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/blob/main/patches/ModelarDB-Extended-Logging.patch) in the [patches](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/tree/main/patches) directory with: `git apply ../patches/ModelarDB-Extended-Logging.patch`
- Run [main.py](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/blob/main/main.py): `python3 main.py`

Please note that configurations in [config.cfg](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/blob/main/config.cfg) are tuned for WTM and thus you are not required to change them when testing with WTM.


### Evaluate OLAP queries in ModelarDB:
  1. Run `git restore .` in *ModelarDB* directory
  2. Change to the project root: `cd ..`
  2. Run `python3 utils/conf_change_olap_querying.py`
  3. Run *loader_querying.sh* with a path to ModelarDB and error bound as an argument like: `./loader_querying.sh ModelarDB/ 0.0`. ModelarDB will start the ingestion of the WTM dataset and open the query interface using [Apache Arrow Flight](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/) at *localhost:9999*
  4. On a separate terminal window run: `python3 run_olap_queries.py`

### ModelarDB in the edge-to-cloud scenario: 
  Transfer efficiency experiments were only performed with the highest frequency, closed dataset PCD. We followed instructions specified in ModelarDB's [user manual](https://github.com/ModelarData/ModelarDB/blob/main/docs/index.md#user-manual) and configuration file.

Other hints:

1. Make sure to configure the same dimensions file and error bound in *modelardb.conf* file of both ModelarDB instances (edge and cloud)
2. Make sure that the cloud instance's *modelardb.conf* enables server transfer mode* like: `modelardb.transfer server`
4. Make sure that the edge instance's *modelardb.conf* file has the cloud instance's IP address for transfer: `modelardb.transfer xxx.xx.xx.xx`
5. Start the cloud and the edge instance either with sbt or a java compiled jar file in the edge and a spark job in the cloud. To check for more options, refer to [ModelarDB's user manual](https://github.com/ModelarData/ModelarDB/blob/main/docs/index.md#install).


\* For transfer efficieny experiments, that require edge-to-cloud environment, make sure that hostname ip resolves to what is shown in ModelarDB's `modelardb.conf` file. Otherwise it needs to be changed from */etc/hosts*

## Run MAPE and OLAP query experiments for __AGG__ and __IoTDB__
Change to [Baselines](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/tree/main/Baselines) directory and choose the subdirectory for the chosen method. There you will find respective bash scripts for each solution and detailed instructions for both [AGG](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/blob/main/Baselines/AGG-Experiments/README.md) and [IoTDB](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/blob/main/Baselines/IoTDB-experiments/README.md). The default configurations for both methods use the available public dataset [WTM](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/tree/main/data).
