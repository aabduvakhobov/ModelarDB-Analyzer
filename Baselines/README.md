## Ingestion and transfer to the cloud
Ingestion and transfer to the cloud is performed with private _PCD_ dataset. However the Java program for the ingestion on the edge node and transfer to the cloud for the PCD can be found [here](https://github.com/aabduvakhobov/ModelarDB-Analyzer/tree/main/Utilities/IoTDB-experiments/IoTB-Ingest-Transfer-Edge).

Before the experiment we start the IoTDB cloud node in with a port 6668 and IoTDB instance on the edge runs on port 6667.


The experiment is performed
